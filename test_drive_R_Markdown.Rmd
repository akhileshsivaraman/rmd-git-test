Keeping the intermediate md file is useful because GitHub treats it like an HTML file and gives you a pseudo-webpage, which can be useful in saving you a lot of work while allowing others to visit and consume your work on GitHub as though it were a webpage. 

We can keep the md file by changing the output in the YAML header as above or by changing output from "html_document" to "github_document".

When you push a markdown file to GitHub it is critical to also commit and push everything inside `foo_files` (which houses any figures that have been created).
